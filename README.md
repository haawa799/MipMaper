MipMaper
========
Important! This is a try-out project, to get under the hood, you should use generateMipmapsForTexture for fast mipmap generation. My manual generator is nearly 100x slower then system one :(

Pure Swift project, in which I'm loading MTLTexture from .png file and then generating mipmap images using Metal kernel functions.
